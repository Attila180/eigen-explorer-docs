Now, for selected routes, you can optionally add a `withTvl` flag to include the Total Value Locked (TVL) breakdown in the response.

This feature provides a detailed breakdown of the TVL for different strategies, saving time to calculate the TVL from shares in your aplication.

## May 1, 2024 - Additional API Routes and Usability Improvements

---

We're excited to announce the addition of two new routes to the EigenExplorer API, [Retrieve AVS Operators](https://docs.eigenexplorer.com/api-reference/endpoint/metrics/retrieve-total-number-of-avs-operators) and [Retrieve AVS Stakers](https://docs.eigenexplorer.com/api-reference/endpoint/metrics/retrieve-total-number-of-avs-stakers). These routes allow developers to track the current operators and stakers associated with a specific AVS address. We are excited to see how the new endpoints will be utilized in the various AVS applications.

Further enhancing the EigenExplorer platform, we've implemented significant usability improvements. Our redesigned error handling provides a top-tier developer experience, ensuring clearer and more actionable feedback. Additionally, we've enriched our API documentation with detailed examples and comprehensive response schemas, going the extra mile to support developers in integrating and leveraging our API effectively.

We are excited to announce the release of the EigenLayer Ethereum Mainnet API, following closely on the heels of our recent launch of the Holesky Testnet API earlier this week. This release achieves parity between the available on-chain data and API support across the EigenLayer smart contracts.

You can now access both the Ethereum Mainnet API at `https://api.eigenexplorer.com` and the Holesky Testnet API at `https://api-holesky.eigenexplorer.com` to programmatically retrieve EigenLayer data.

## April 15, 2024 - Initial API Release

---

Today we are releasing the first version of the EigenExplorer API, allowing developers to access EigenLayer AVS data programmatically. The API provides endpoints for retrieving general EigenLayer metrics, AVS, operators, and stakers data, as well as strategy information. In the upcoming days, we will be adding more endpoints and features to the API, including historical data and API authentication. We are excited to see what you will build with the EigenExplorer API!

## April 3, 2024 - Usability Improvement

---

To ensure a high level of usability and accessibility, I've decided to postpone the release of individual AVS detail pages and instead focus on enhancing the overall user experience of EigenExplorer. Rest assured, the AVS detail pages are still in development and will be launched soon.

Having said that, I've implemented several improvements to the platform, including:

1. Revamped the mobile navigation menu with smooth animations to enhance user interaction.
2. Introduced animations to the home page hero section for a visually appealing experience.
3. Refactored the data fetching logic from the frontend and redesigned the backend API. This update also means that API services will soon be available for public use.

Exciting features are in the pipeline, and I'm eager to share them with you. Stay tuned for further updates!

## April, 2024 - EigenExplorer Launch

---

I'm excited to finally announce the launch of EigenExplorer, a community-driven data platform for EigenLayer AVS.

As of March 2024, the M2 release of EigenLayer is just around the corner, yet there is still a lot of work to be done to organize and present the data concerning AVS, LST/LRT, Operators, etc. For the initial launch, my focus is on the listings of AVS, both recognized and unrecognized by the EigenLayer team.

In the upcoming months, more features will be released incrementally. Currently, I am working on individual AVS pages, an overview of the EigenLayer ecosystem, and a new strategies section that will house various LST and LRT strategies.

I'd like to thank everyone who has supported, provided feedback, and contributed to this project. Your support is greatly appreciated. Thank you üôè
