## April 15, 2024 - Initial API Release

---

Today we are releasing the first version of the Eigen Explorer API, allowing developers to access Eigen Layer AVS data programmatically. The API provides endpoints for retrieving general Eigen Layer metrics, AVS, operators, and stakers data, as well as strategy information. In the upcoming days, we will be adding more endpoints and features to the API, including historical data and API authentication. We are excited to see what you will build with the Eigen Explorer API!

## April 3, 2024 - Usability Improvement

---

To ensure a high level of usability and accessibility, I've decided to postpone the release of individual AVS detail pages and instead focus on enhancing the overall user experience of Eigen Explorer. Rest assured, the AVS detail pages are still in development and will be launched soon.

Having said that, I've implemented several improvements to the platform, including:

1. Revamped the mobile navigation menu with smooth animations to enhance user interaction.
2. Introduced animations to the home page hero section for a visually appealing experience.
3. Refactored the data fetching logic from the frontend and redesigned the backend API. This update also means that API services will soon be available for public use.

Exciting features are in the pipeline, and I'm eager to share them with you. Stay tuned for further updates!

## April, 2024 - Eigen Explorer Launch

---

I'm excited to finally announce the launch of Eigen Explorer, a community-driven data platform for Eigen Layer AVS.

As of March 2024, the M2 release of Eigen Layer is just around the corner, yet there is still a lot of work to be done to organize and present the data concerning AVS, LST/LRT, Operators, etc. For the initial launch, my focus is on the listings of AVS, both recognized and unrecognized by the Eigen Layer team.

In the upcoming months, more features will be released incrementally. Currently, I am working on individual AVS pages, an overview of the Eigen Layer ecosystem, and a new strategies section that will house various LST and LRT strategies.

I'd like to thank everyone who has supported, provided feedback, and contributed to this project. Your support is greatly appreciated. Thank you üôè
