## March, 2024 - Eigen Explorer Launch

---

I'm excited to finally announce the launch of Eigen Explorer, a community-driven data platform for Eigen Layer AVS.

As of March 2024, the M2 release of Eigen Layer is just around the corner, yet there is still a lot of work to be done to organize and present the data concerning AVS, LST/LRT, Operators, etc. For the initial launch, my focus is on the listings of AVS, both recognized and unrecognized by the Eigen Layer team.

In the upcoming months, more features will be released incrementally. Currently, I am working on individual AVS pages, an overview of the Eigen Layer ecosystem, and a new strategies section that will house various LST and LRT strategies.

I'd like to thank everyone who has supported, provided feedback, and contributed to this project. Your support is greatly appreciated. Thank you üôè
