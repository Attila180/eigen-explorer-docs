## Introduction

Currently, all AVS data is sourced from the [AVS Directory](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/dev/src/contracts/core/AVSDirectory.sol) and undergoes manual cleaning and verification afterward. Additionally, some AVS projects are also collected from publicly submitted forms.

### AVS Stakers and Operators

Data pertaining to AVS stakers and operators, including current and historical information, rankings, and more, will be released shortly.

### AVS Risks

We are in the process of developing a risk assessment framework for AVS projects. This framework will include a risk score and breakdown. Integration of this data will occur following the release of the Eigen Layer M3 testnet.
