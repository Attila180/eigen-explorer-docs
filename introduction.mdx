## Why Eigen Explorer

We have many explorers, dashboards, and analytics tools. Why add another one?

Eigen Layer AVS presents a peculiar case. It not only introduces a completely new project and asset class but also brings with it several new data structures and categories. This new landscape opens up the vast and emerging field of the Eigen Layer ecosystem, necessitating its own unique approach to exploring AVS projects and their associated data.

In Eigen Explorer, as each AVS will feature its own unique node infrastructure and data verification schema, the specific risks of slashing, distribution of rewards, methods of data verification, and staker and operator data will be presented visually for an intuitive understanding. Additionally, in future versions, users will be able to directly interact with the AVS operations, including becoming a staker or operator.

We hope to aggregate the currently scattered information for the stakers, operators, and project developers and provide easy access to the data and tools needed to make informed decisions.

With that, I'd like to thank everyone who has supported, provided feedback, and contributed to this project. Your support is greatly appreciated. Thank you üôè
