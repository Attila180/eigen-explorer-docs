Generating Liquid AVS Token is easy. Depending the asset of your choice, there are currently two ways for acquiring a LAT.

<Steps>
    <Step title='With AVS Token'>
        Users are able to stake their AVS token(s) into the corresponding AVS,
        receiving the liquid staked equivalent in return. For example, users
        could deposit the EigenDA token (EIGEN) into EigenDA on EigenExplorer,
        receiving xEIGEN in return.
    </Step>
    <Step title='With LST or Native ETH'>
        Users are also able to deposit LST or native ETH into a specific AVS,
        with the ETH deposited exclusively amongst operators for that specific
        AVS. For example, users could stake ETH into EigenExplorer and allocate
        it to EigenDA, which would be delegated exclusively to EigenDA
        operators. The userâ€™s stake is siloed to the AVS they wish to support,
        and they receive xEIGEN in return.
    </Step>
