Liquid AVS Tokens (LATs) are a new category of assets designed by EigenExplorer specifically for the [EigenLayer](/knowledge-base/eigen-layer) ecosystem, allowing users to hold their (re)staked tokens in liquid form and helping to promote a sustainable and efficient environment for AVS and their users.

LAT functions alongside two existing token classes: [Ethereum Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs)](/glossaries/lst), and [native AVS tokens](/glossaries/avs-token) issued by AVS protocols built on EigenLayer.

<Tip>
    LATs can also be called X tokens. The actual Liquid AVS Token you receive
    after staking will be prefixed with an "x". For example, the LAT for the
    EigenDA AVS is called xEIGEN.
</Tip>

With the Liquid AVS token, you will be able to:

1.  Directly restake into the AVS of your choice.
2.  Automaticically handle operator selection.
3.  Provide a liquid token for other DeFi activities.
4.  Enjoy improved token utility, efficiency, and user experience.
