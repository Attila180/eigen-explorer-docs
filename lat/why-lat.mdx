## Liquid AVS Token Benefits

While EigenLayer restaking enhances the capital efficiency of ETH/LST holders through shared security, it does not allow users to choose which AVS benefits from their staked Ether or LSTs.

Instead, the operator or the liquid restaking token (LRT) platforms, such as Renzo, EtherFi, and Puffer, decide which AVS to validate at any given time. This delegation of decision directly impacts your risk exposure and potential yield. Although diversification is achieved by holding or staking across multiple AVS, the operator delegation and LRT model complicate overall risk management, reward distribution, user experience, and support for a desired AVS.

Liquid AVS Token introduces a modular restaking asset that simplifies and balances EigenLayerâ€™s token landscape, empowering both users and AVS teams.

On EigenExplorer, users can choose to stake their Ether, LST, or a native AVS token directly into a specific AVS. The (re)staked token is automatically channeled to the AVS of their choice through an operator selection process that prioritizes operators with a high percentage of that AVS's operator share or those that exclusively operate that specific AVS. Subsequently, the corresponding amount of LAT is generated as an on-chain representation of the user's staked position, along with any rewards that position will accrue.

Because of the unique design of LAT, users can enjoy the following benefits:

### 1. Direct AVS Support

Users can directly support the protocols they find compelling, rather than having their staking contributions bundled for general validation and rewarded inefficiently with yields from less attractive projects. This approach allows users to retain direct risk exposure to their chosen AVS, enabling them to restake according to their individual risk and return preferences.

### 2. Improved Yield

In addition to the yield or rewards generated by the AVS, LAT holders also receive EigenLayer rewards in the form of EIGEN tokens and EigenExplorer rewards. These rewards are auto-compounded for further yield optimization. See more about rewards [here](/lat/cost).

### 2. Improved Capital Efficiency

With renewed access to liquidity, EigenExplorer users can utilize LATs across various DeFi protocols. The token can be traded, invested, and used as collateral like any other cryptocurrency, in addition to its AVS-specific functions.

### 4. Streamlined User Experience

The direct re(staking) process eliminates the need for users to worry about operator selection in the traditional restaking workflow. Once users choose their desired AVS, they simply click the stake button, and they are good to go.

### 5. Composable Assets

Due to the direct risk and return exposure to a specific AVS, LAT can serve as a foundational restaking asset in the DeFi ecosystem, enabling the creation of more advanced restaking strategies or products. With EigenExplorer's integrated dashboard, users can create and monitor a real-time restaking portfolio, managing risk exposure all in one place.
