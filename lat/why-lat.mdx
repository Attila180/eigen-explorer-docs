## Liquid AVS Token Benefits

While EigenLayer restaking improves LST capital efficiency via shared security, restakers are unable to choose which AVS benefits from their staked Ether or LSTs. Generally, the liquid restaking token (LRT) provider platforms such as Renzo, EtherFi and Puffer determine which AVS to validate at any given time, as well as how any yield is distributed to users. Despite the risk diversification benefits, LRTs make overall risk management, reward distribution, user experience and supporting a desired AVS harder.

LATs introduces a modular restaking product that simplifies and balances EigenLayer’s token landscape, empowering both users and AVS teams.

When a user stakes Ether or stakes a native AVS token with EigenExplorer, the corresponding amount of LAT is generated as an on-chain representation of the position. Users can then assign LAT to the individual AVS or AVS group of their choosing.

### 1. Direct AVS Support

This is of natural benefit for users: they are empowered to support the protocols that they find compelling, rather than seeing their staking contributions bundled for general validation use and rewarded inefficiently with yield from less attractive projects. They also retain a direct risk exposure to their chosen AVSs, which allows users to construct their own diversification strategies suited to their specific risk profiles.

### 2. Improved Capital Efficiency

With renewed access to liquidity, EigenExplorer users are also free to use LATs in the contexts of their choosing across DeFi protocols. The token can be traded, invested and used as collateral like any other cryptocurrency, on top of its AVS-specific functions.

### 3. Composable Assets

Further, LAT leverages EigenExplorer’s rich data capabilities to provide a real-time portfolio management and risk assessment tool. As LAT is generated, the underlying staked and restaked assets are tracked and categorized in a single interface, giving users a convenient view of their full portfolio, regardless of where in the ecosystem assets are deployed.

Whether you’re earning yield as an operator, EigenLayer points as a restaker, EigenExplorer rewards as a LAT user or a combination of all three, the service provides a comprehensive and constantly updating record of your on-chain activity.
