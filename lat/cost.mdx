## Fee Structure

There are no direct fees associated with (re)staking through an LAT, except for the gas fees incurred when (re)staking your tokens on the Ethereum mainnet.

Indirect fees come from the AVS rewards.

## Rewards

Liquid AVS Token users are rewarded through:

<Steps>
    <Step title='AVS (Re)Staking Rewards'>
        AVS (re)staking rewards are determined by the individual AVS teams,
        communities, or DAOs. The final reward distribution is the AVS reward
        minus the operator fees, which are set by each AVS operator.
    </Step>
    <Step title='EigenLayer Points'>
        EigenLayer points are governed by the EigenLayer Foundation and DAO.
    </Step>
    <Step title='EigenExplorer Rewards'>
        EigenExplorer's own incentivization mechanisms for Liquid AVS Token
        users. These rewards are governed by the EigenExplorer community.
    </Step>
</Steps>

Of the **AVS rewards you receive (post operator fees)**, EigenExplorer will take a **10% share** to support protocol development, community incentivization, and governance.
