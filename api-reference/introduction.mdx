## Welcome

Eigen Explorer provides an array of API endpoints organized around REST for community users and developers to quickly access data and information about the Eigen Layer ecosystem.

Our API features predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and adheres to standard HTTP response codes, authentication methods, and verbs.

Currently, the API is free to use and open to the public. Please note that the API is currently in Beta and may be subject to change.

## Ethereum Mainnet and Holesky Testnet API

Currently, we support both Ethereum Mainnet and Holesky Testnet API. The mainnet API uses the following base URL:

```
https://api.eigenexplorer.com
```

while the Holeksy testnet API uses the following base URL:

```
https://api-holesky.eigenexplorer.com
```

The API endpoints are the same for both networks, but the data returned will be different. Please make sure to use the correct base URL when making requests.

<Note>
    Please note that the sample requests and responses in this documentation are
    based on the Ethereum Mainnet API.
