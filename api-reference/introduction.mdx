## Welcome

<Note>
    For Liquid AVS Token documentation, please refer to [**this
    section**](/lat/introduction).
</Note>

EigenExplorer provides an array of API endpoints organized around REST for community users and developers to quickly access data and information about the EigenLayer ecosystem.

Our API features predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and adheres to standard HTTP response codes, authentication methods, and verbs.

The API is free to use and open to the public.

## Ethereum Mainnet and Holesky Testnet API

We support both Ethereum Mainnet and Holesky Testnet API. The mainnet API uses the following base URL:

```
https://api.eigenexplorer.com
```

while the Holeksy testnet API uses the following base URL:

```
https://api-holesky.eigenexplorer.com
```

The API endpoints are the same for both networks, but the data returned will be different. Please make sure to use the correct base URL when making requests.

<Note>
    Please note that the sample requests and responses in this documentation are
    based on the Ethereum Mainnet API.
