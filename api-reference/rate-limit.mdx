A rate limit of **30 requests per minute** is currently enforced for the **Holesky Testnet** to promote fair usage. This helps prevent excessive usage by a single user from impacting the performance and availability of the API for others.

If the rate limit is exceeded, a `429 Too Many Requests` response will be returned.

If you need to incrase your rate limit, please contact us via [Support Telegram](https://t.me/+siHEtj56TNdmZmU1).
