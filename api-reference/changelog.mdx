## August 15, 2024 - Version 0.2.0 Release

---

We are excited to announce the release of **version 0.2.0** of the **Eigen Explorer API**, packed with powerful new features, enhanced capabilities, and optimized performance. This update includes several new API routes, expanded metrics, and more refined query options, providing developers with a richer and more flexible experience when working with the EigenLayer ecosystem.

### **Comprehensive Overview of New Features and Enhancements**

This version introduces significant improvements across the board, adding both new functionalities and enhancing existing routes to offer more precise, detailed, and useful data to developers. Here's a breakdown of the key updates:

### **Enhanced Metrics Capabilities**

#### **Retrieve Strategy TVL by Name**
We have added an enhancement to the [Retrieve a strategy TVL by name](https://docs.eigenexplorer.com/api-reference/endpoint/metrics/retrieve-a-strategy-tvl-by-name) endpoint. Now, the response includes a new field, `tvlEth`, representing the Total Value Locked (TVL) of the restaking strategy, denominated in ETH. This provides a clearer and more meaningful insight into the value locked in each strategy within the ecosystem, enabling developers to track and analyze strategies with greater accuracy.

#### **Entity Growth Tracking**
Tracking the growth of various entities within the EigenLayer ecosystem is now more insightful with the following enhancements:
- **AVS Count Growth**: The [Retrieve total number of AVS](https://docs.eigenexplorer.com/api-reference/endpoint/metrics/retrieve-total-number-of-avs) endpoint now includes metrics showing the **24-hour** and **7-day** changes in AVS count, allowing developers to understand the dynamics of new AVS entries.
- **Operator and Staker Growth**: Similarly, the [Retrieve total number of AVS operators](https://docs.eigenexplorer.com/api-reference/endpoint/metrics/retrieve-total-number-of-avs-operators) and [Retrieve total number of AVS stakers](https://docs.eigenexplorer.com/api-reference/endpoint/metrics/retrieve-total-number-of-avs-stakers) endpoints now return data reflecting the growth trends over the last day and week, providing a broader perspective on operator and staker participation.

    </Frame>
These metrics make it easier to track the development and engagement within the EigenLayer ecosystem, helping developers understand how quickly the network is expanding.

#### **Withdrawal and Deposit Totals**
We've introduced two new endpoints that provide aggregate data on the total number of withdrawals and deposits:
- **Total Withdrawals**: The [Retrieve total number of withdrawals](https://docs.eigenexplorer.com/api-reference/endpoint/metrics/retrieve-total-number-of-withdrawals) (`/metrics/total-withdrawals`) endpoint offers a comprehensive overview of withdrawal activities within the network.
- **Total Deposits**: The [Retrieve total number of deposits](https://docs.eigenexplorer.com/api-reference/endpoint/metrics/retrieve-total-number-of-deposits) (`/metrics/total-deposits`) endpoint provides insight into the deposit volume across the ecosystem.

These endpoints are crucial for monitoring and analyzing the flow of assets within EigenLayer, giving developers the tools to oversee and manage the network’s economic activities effectively.

### **Introduction of Historical Data Tracking**

#### **Historical TVL Data**
Understanding the historical trends of TVL within the EigenLayer ecosystem is now possible with the following newly introduced routes:
- **Overall TVL History**: The [Retrieve historical total TVL data](https://docs.eigenexplorer.com/api-reference/endpoint/metrics/retrieve-historical-tvl) (`/metrics/historical/tvl`) route allows developers to query TVL data over time, providing valuable insights into the network's growth.
- **Beacon Chain TVL History**: For those focusing on the Beacon Chain, the [Retrieve historical Beacon Chain restaking TVL](https://docs.eigenexplorer.com/api-reference/endpoint/metrics/retrieve-historical-tvl-beacon-chain) (`/metrics/historical/tvl/beacon-chain`) route provides targeted historical data specific to it.
- **Strategy-Specific TVL History**: Developers can now track TVL for individual strategies using the [Retrieve historical TVL data by strategy address](https://docs.eigenexplorer.com/api-reference/endpoint/metrics/retrieve-historical-tvl-restaking-by-strategy-address) (`/metrics/historical/tvl/restaking/{address}`) route.

### **Improved AVS and Operator Query Options**

#### **Curated Metadata for AVS**
Curated metadata is a mechanism that allows for the manual overriding or enhancement of the standard metadata associated with AVS entities. This feature is particularly useful when there is a need to refine or supplement the data for better accuracy. 
The curated metadata can include various attributes such as Tags, which help categorize and label AVS entities more effectively.

The [Retrieve all AVS](https://docs.eigenexplorer.com/api-reference/endpoint/avs/retrieve-all-avs) and [Retrieve an AVS by address](https://docs.eigenexplorer.com/api-reference/endpoint/avs/retrieve-an-avs-by-address) endpoints now include an optional `withCuratedMetadata` flag. This flag allows developers to retrieve curated metadata for AVS, offering richer and more detailed information about each AVS entity.

            alt='Changelog Image for August 15th'
        />
    </Frame>
We’ve added two new routes that offer greater flexibility and precision in managing deposit data within EigenLayer:

#### **Individual Deposit Routes - `/deposits`**
The [Retrieve all deposits](https://docs.eigenexplorer.com/api-reference/endpoint/deposits/retrieve-all-deposits) (`/deposits`) route is a robust tool for querying the entire deposit history or retrieving specific deposit records. You can filter deposits by:
- **Staker Address**: Track deposits associated with specific stakers.
- **Token Address**: Filter deposits by the token used, providing insights into token-specific activity.
- **Strategy Address**: Focus on deposits tied to particular strategies within the ecosystem.

These filters allow you to customize your queries to retrieve exactly the data you need, making it easier to monitor and analyze deposit activities.

#### **Nested Deposit Routes - `/stakers/{address}/deposits`**
To simplify the retrieval of deposit data for individual stakers, we’ve introduced the [Retrieve all deposits by staker address](https://docs.eigenexplorer.com/api-reference/endpoint/stakers/retrieve-all-deposits-by-staker-address) (`/stakers/{address}/deposits`) endpoint. This route provides a streamlined way to access and organize deposit information specific to a single staker, making it easier to track and analyze their deposit behavior.

These new deposit routes offer a deeper level of insight into deposit patterns within EigenLayer, empowering developers to manage and analyze staking activities more effectively.

We are thrilled to announce the addition of two new types of API routes for querying EigenLayer withdrawal data. Efficient withdrawal management is essential for overseeing and accounting for staking activities in the EigenLayer ecosystem. Now you can directly access `withdrawals` and `stakers/:address/withdrawals` routes to retrieve detailed withdrawal information.

1. Individual Routes - `/withdrawals`
   We’ve introduced brand new routes to query all withdrawal history or retrieve individual withdrawal data. Now, you can filter withdrawals by staker address, delegated operator, strategy address, and withdrawal status. This added flexibility allows you to pinpoint specific operators and combine various query parameters to suit your needs.

1. Nested Routes - `/stakers/{address}/withdrawals`
   To make your REST queries even smoother, we’ve rolled out nested routes that simplify the process of retrieving withdrawals for specific stakers. Use `/stakers/:address/withdrawals` to list all withdrawals for a staker. Plus, you can access queued, queued and withdrawable, and completed withdrawals through dedicated routes for more precise queries.

With these new withdrawal data routes, you can now access detailed information on staker withdrawals, greatly enhancing your ability to manage and analyze staking activities. As always, if you have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to seeing how you leverage these new routes in your applications!
